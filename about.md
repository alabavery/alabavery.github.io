I am a software engineer in Chicago, Illinois.  I'm an avid biker (even in the winter), an improv performer, and a musician.  I've been developing software off and on for a few years, and full-time for nine months.  

I'm currently seeking career opportunities and would love to get in contact about that.  I'm also open to mentoring beginning programmers (for free).
