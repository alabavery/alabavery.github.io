I am a software engineer in Chicago, Illinois.  I'm an avid biker (even in the winter), an improv performer, and a musician.  I've been developing software off and on for a few years, and full-time since May 2016. 

I'm currently seeking career opportunities and would love to get in contact about that.  I'm also open to mentoring beginning programmers (for free).  See the footer for ways to contact me.
