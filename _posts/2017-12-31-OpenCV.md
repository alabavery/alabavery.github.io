title: Making Music Videos with Computer Vision
---
Computer vision is already meeting some incredibly important needs around the world.  But let's not forget that we can use it to do really stupid, useless things too.  I am working on a program that takes a user-created video, determines the beats-per-minute suggested by the user's movement, and creates a corresponding 'music video'.  The program uses OpenCV, a computer vision framework with a C++ API, which it strings together with some other OSX tools using bash scripting.  Coming soon!
