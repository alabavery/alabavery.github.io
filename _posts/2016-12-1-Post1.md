title: Introducing Parking Panic Solver
---
There’s a game on the kid’s site coolmath-games.com called Parking Panic.  It’s really fun, and probably good for intellectual development in some way.  [Check it out.](http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-parking-panic). I learned about this game last year, soon after I started programming full-time. So naturally I wondered if you could find a programmatic solution to it.

It turns out you can.  I wrote programs in C++ and Python that do just that.  Both programs use Python's matplotlib library to display the results.  Check out a clip of me (the human) beating level one alongside the C++ program beating level one below.  You can find links to the full codebases for each of the programs as well (caution: the Python version is pretty sloppy).
