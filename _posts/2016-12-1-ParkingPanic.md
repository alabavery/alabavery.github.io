title: A Programmatic Solution to "Parking Panic"
---
There’s a game on the kid’s site coolmath-games.com called Parking Panic.  It’s really fun, and probably good for intellectual development in some way.  [Check it out.](http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-parking-panic) I learned about this game last year, soon after I started programming full-time. So naturally I wondered if you could find a programmatic solution to it.

It turns out you can.  I wrote programs in C++ and Python that use Python's matplotlib library to display their solutions to each level.  Check out a clip of the C++ program beating level one below.  Here are links to the code bases for [the C++ version](https://github.com/alabavery/Cpp-arkingPanicSolver) and the [python version](https://github.com/alabavery/ParkingPanicSolver). If you're learning one of these languages and you'd like help recreating the program on your own, feel free to contact me.
