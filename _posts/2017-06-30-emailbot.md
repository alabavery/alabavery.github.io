title: Email Bot for Activist Organization
---
Here's what I'm working on now: A Python bot that handles incoming email requests for New York state votersâ€™ addresses. Packaged as user-friendly executable so that non-tech-savvy admin can click once to run the Python code, access and store data locally, and receive and send emails. Will be used by 24,000+ member activist organization in NY elections in September and potentially in elections nationwide thereafter
